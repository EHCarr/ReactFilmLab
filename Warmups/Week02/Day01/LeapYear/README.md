# Leap Year Warmup Exercise


Write a function that will take any given year and return whether it is a leap year or not.
Remember that a leap year is:

- Every year that is evenly divisible by 4
- Except if it is evenly divisible by 100...
- Unless it is also divisible by 400 

Test Data...  Make sure it is working!

- 1997 is not a leap year, it should return **false**
- 1996 is a leap year, it should return **true**
- 1900 is not a leap year, it should return **false**
- 2000 is a leap year, it should return **true**

How to structure it...
- We want a custom function called isLeapYear

Bonus!

- Ask the user what number they want to test
- Watch a whole heap of information about leap years... http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX96xng7sAE
