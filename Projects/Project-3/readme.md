# Project #3: Full Stack Application! 

## Overview:


**You will be working as a team for this project**, everyone must contribute.  If 1 person does not contribute or 1 person does all the work then the entire team will fail the project requirements.  If you pair program then please include the other persons github name in the commit.

## What You've Learned

By the time you submit this project, you will have covered new ground in, and reviewed, many of the big themes of the course so far:

- **Command Line**: Practice interacting with the computer and navigating the filesystem from the command line.
- **Source Control**: Manage and interact with a git repository to store changes to code.
- **Programming Fundamentals**: Work with objects, constructors, events, while learning how to strategically solve problems and resolve errors.
- **Web Fundamentals**: Learn how communication happens over the internet, and how to structure, style, and animate documents within a browser. Also learn how to respond to actions your users take and the data they input into the browser.
- **Browser Applications**: Dive into CSS, and figure out how to use libraries and frameworks to get lots of style and functionality for free.
- **Deployment on GitHub Pages**: Host a web application in a managed hosting environment.
- **Server Side Applications**: Server-side scripting is a technique used in web development which involves employing scripts on a web server which produce a response customized for each user's (client's) request to the website.
- **Databases**: A structured set of data held in a computer, especially one that is accessible in various ways.
- **NoSQL**: NoSQL is used to communicate with a database. It is the standard language for relational database management systems. NoSQL statements are used to perform tasks such as update data on a database, or retrieve data from a database.
- **Node**: An open-source, cross-platform JavaScript run-time environment that executes JavaScript code outside of a browser.
- **NPM**: A package manager for Node.js packages, or modules 
- **Express**: A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications.
- **Mongodb**: A cross-platform document-oriented database program. Classified as a NoSQL database program, MongoDB uses JSON-like documents with schema.
- **Mongoose**: Provides a schema-based solution for object modeling with Node.js to model your Mongodb data.
- **Deployment on Heroku**: Host a web application on heroku server.
- **Sql**: (pronounced "ess-que-el") stands for Structured Query Language. SQL is used to communicate with a database. 
- **PostgreSQL** : is a powerful, open source object-relational database system with over 30 years of active development that has earned it a strong reputation for reliability, feature robustness, and performance
- **Python**: Python is an interpreted high-level general-purpose programming language.
- **ORM**: Object–relational mapping in computer science is a programming technique for converting data between incompatible type
- **Django**: Django is a high-level Python Web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design.
- **MVT** : The MVT (Model View Template) is a software design pattern. It is a collection of three important components Model View and Template.


## Technical Requirements


- **Create the application using at least 2 related models**, one of which should be a user
- Include **all major CRUD functions** for at least one of your models


- Add authentication **AND authorization** \(page protection\) to restrict access to appropriate users 
    - User must be able to sign up or login
    - Signed in user must be able to change password and logout
    - change password and logout must only be available to logged in users
- Give feedback to the user after each action, and after form submissions with success/failure. 
- Clear forms after submission failure.
- **Manage team contributions and collaboration** using a standard Git flow on Github
- Layout and style your front-end with **clean & well-formatted CSS**, with or without a framework.
**Put efforts into your design!**
- **Deploy your application online** so it's publicly accessible. (We will walk through the setup. Make sure you guys have same directory sturcture as I have for cat collector. Initialze git when you are inside you project folder, check cat collector for reference.)

### Stretch Goals
- Allow user to change website theme, Dark mode etc. 
- Include Pagination.
- Utilize 3rd party API's.
- Sent verification email upon registeration. 
- Allow users to upload image files.
- Password reset using an email.



## Necessary Deliverables
- Projects are due on Friday, 07th Oct 2022 at 10.30am!
- You have to fill the [google sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1aomZtNggeeAoQ7wzkJ5slmp-gLpWmdW5/edit#gid=1044180768) with you name, github link and deployed link.
- A **working app**, hosted somewhere on the internet
- A **link to your hosted working app** in the URL section of your Github repo
- A **git repository hosted on Github**, with a link to your hosted project, and frequent commits dating back to the very beginning of the project
- **A `readme.md` file** with:
  - An embedded screenshot of the app
  - Explanations of the **technologies** used
  - A couple paragraphs about the **general approach you took**
  - **Installation instructions** for any dependencies
  - Documentation of your **application architecture**
      - Entity Relationship Diagram **(ERD)** or **Data Model.**
      - Your **user stories** – who are your users, what do they want, and why?
      - Your **wireframes** – sketches of major views / interfaces in your application
  - Descriptions of any **unsolved problems** or **major hurdles** you had to overcome


## Suggested Ways to Start
- **PLAN PLAN PLAN** and then **PLAN SOME MORE** before you write any code make sure that you and your team have thoroughly planned your project. Almost every serious headache you run into later is a result of inadequate planning.
- **Don’t hesitate to write throwaway code** to solve short-term problems.
- **Read the docs for whatever technologies, frameworks, or API’s you use.**
- **Be consistent with your code style.** You're working in teams, but you're only making one app per team. Make sure it looks like a unified effort.
- **Commit early, commit often.** Don’t be afraid to break something because you can always go back in time to a previous version.
- **Keep user stories small and well-defined.** Remember – user stories focus on what a user needs, not what development tasks need accomplishing.
- **Write code another developer wouldn't have to ask you about.** Do your naming conventions make sense? Would another developer be able to look at your app and understand what everything is?
- **Make it all well-formatted.** Are you indenting, consistently? Can we find the start and end of every div, curly brace, etc.?
- **Comment your code.** Will someone understand what is going on in each block or function? Even if it's obvious, explaining the what & why means someone else can pick it up and get it.
- **Write pseudocode before you write actual code.** Thinking through the logic of something helps.
