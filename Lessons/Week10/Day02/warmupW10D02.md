# Warmup No 1
# Better Than Average
There was a test in your class and you passed it. Congratulations!
But you're an ambitious person. You want to know if you're better than the average student in your class.

You receive an array with your peers' test scores. Now calculate the average and compare your score!

Return True if you're better, else False!

Note:
Your points are not included in the array of your class's points. For calculating the average point you may add your point to the given array!

```
function betterThanAverage(classPoints, yourPoints) {
  // Your code here
 }
```

Exmaples:
```
betterThanAverage([2, 3], 5) => true
betterThanAverage([41, 75, 72, 56, 80, 82, 81, 33], 50) => false
```

# Nested Array and Object

- Write a function named fromPairs that creates an object from an array containing nested arrays.
- Each nested array will have two elements representing key/value pairs used to create key/value pairs in an object to be returned by the function.
- If a key appears in multiple pairs, the rightmost pair should overwrite the previous entry in the object.

Examples:

```
fromPairs([ ['a', 1], ['b', 2], ['c', 3] ]) //=> { a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 }
fromPairs([ ['name', 'Sam"], ['age', 24], ['name', 'Sally'] ]) //=> { name: "Sally", age: 24 }
```
